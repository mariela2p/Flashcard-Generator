# Flashcard-Generator

## Advanced JavaScript Assignment

In this week's assignment, you will create the backend for a basic flashcard application.

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front(the question) and a back(the answer).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text and a cloze deletion (that would be the answer).
